# Bit Torrent
This is a recreation of BitTorrent version 1.0, a project intended for personal learning.
The goal of this project is to help me learn more about distributed systems and 
and other infrastructure programming in C++ like networking and concurrency. 

I followed this [wiki](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification) as project spec.
